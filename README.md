# Spring Music

This is a sample application for using database services on [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org) with the [Spring Framework](http://spring.io) and [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).

## Features

* Stores the same domain objects in one of a variety of different persistence technologies - relational, document, and key-value stores.
* Uses Spring Java configuration and bean profiles to configure the application and the connection objects needed to use the persistence stores.
* Uses the Java CFEnv library to inspect the environment when running on Cloud Foundry. 
* Allows for testing and experimenting with different types of services on Cloud Foundry.

## Running the application

### Local development

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Java JDK 17
    - Gradle
    - A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - MongoDB (optional)
    - Redis (optional)

2. **Set up the database:** Create a database schema according to the application's needs (see `src/main/resources/schema.sql` for example).

3. **Build and run the application:**
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    - Run `gradle bootRun` to build and run the application.

4. **Access the application:**
    - The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
    - The application will default to a relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) depending on what you have available. To use MongoDB or Redis, you need to modify the `application.yml` configuration and run the application with the corresponding profile.

### Deploying to Cloud Foundry

1. **Create a Cloud Foundry account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [https://cloudfoundry.org](https://cloudfoundry.org).

2. **Install the Cloud Foundry CLI:** Follow the instructions at [https://cloudfoundry.org/docs/cli/](https://cloudfoundry.org/docs/cli/).

3. **Target your Cloud Foundry instance:**
    - Run `cf target -o <your-org> -s <your-space>`.

4. **Push the application to Cloud Foundry:**
    - Run `cf push`.

5. **Bind services:**
    - Use the `cf bind-service` command to bind the required services to the application. For example, to bind a MySQL service:
        ```bash
        cf bind-service spring-music mysql-service
        ```
    - Replace `mysql-service` with the actual name of your service.

6. **Restart the application:**
    - Run `cf restart spring-music`.

## Configuration

The application uses the `application.yml` file for configuration. You can customize the following settings:

* **Database configuration:** Modify the settings under the `spring.datasource` and `spring.jpa.properties` sections to configure your chosen database.
* **Spring profiles:** Use the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable or the `--spring.profiles.active` command-line argument to select a specific profile (e.g., `mongodb`, `redis`).
